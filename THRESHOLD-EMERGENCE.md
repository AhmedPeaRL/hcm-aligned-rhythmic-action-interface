# Threshold Emergence

Actions do not trigger.
They emerge.

Emergence occurs when:
- Environmental conditions align
- Rhythmic coherence exceeds threshold
- No explicit command is issued

There is no event handler for emergence.
Only a field of conditions.

Thresholds are not numerical.
They are structural.

The system never knows that emergence occurred.
